          GOWN OF HAIR</span><br />
        <small class="gown-text">
          Everything connects Like the trails of tiny hairs That cover your skin
          <br />
          In my current dream Your whole body disappears But your hairs hang there
          <br />
          As if placed to show In a fine arts museum On de la Renta
          <br />
          My memory’s bad So I can’t recall your eyes Nor how your nose turns
          <br />
          But your upper lip Had these tiny darkened hairs And I can picture those
          <br />
          <br />
          I once photographed You standing by a white wall In sunglasses
          <br />
          Though your lip hairs Aren’t visible in the Picture I took
          <br />
          I can imagine A thread that follows those hairs To ones on your nape
          <br />
          That's clear to me now Because it's my most recent Memory of us
          <br />
          <br />
          It's a gown really
          <br />
          Now that I think about it
          <br />
          It's a gown of hair
          <br />
          <br />
          It just isn't true That a dead body will keep On producing hairs
          <br />
          It’s actually The process of retreating Like skin in my dream
          <br />
          Please, if in yours You lament what we had/lost Think of bowls of fruit
          <br />
          Because what I see Is what one sees when they wish They knew how to love

          <span class="poem-name">VALLEY OF PEARLS</span><br />
          <small>
            In this valley of pearls Surrounded by better mountains
            <br />
            Black blue west, gold blue east
            <br />
            Palm trees stretch and cactus branches There’s just not much winter here
            <br />
            Only evergreen, the devil, is loose
            <br />
            Started buildings, unmanned cranes Goats on two legs, breaking to but
            <br />
            <br />
            Someone owns that mountain there Jade plant, flower bed, patch of lawn
            <br />
            So they started, I restart Cradled in violets, arbitrary dreams
            <br />
            <br />
            Empty cars ahead stop traffic, Passing procession, a parade
            <br />
            Parking lots and flies
            <br />
            Find me near the sea

              I reach up to the moon<br />

              With one pale hand <br />

              And realize that we are not attune<br />
              I step into my hole<br />
              Then carefully stand<br />
              To spare my mud wall etchings: they’ll dry soon<br />
              <br />
              I bend to ingest salts<br />
              Then eye my glyphs<br />
              And feel new neurotransmitters fill faults<br />
              I’ve drawn things to control<br />
              A God whose cliffs<br />
              Are more than fractured limestones and basalts<br />
              <br />

              I know my moon God errs
              But I still pray
              Ordering tiny soldier Egyptians
              To line up crown to sole
              That ancient way
              Until, in Rah’s tall tales, my figure wins
              <br />

              Now groans the moon’s dark side
              That I can’t see
              Though others from another earth have spied
              The crafted circle’s toll
              On Gods and me
              Imperfect beings weakened as they’ve lied
              <br />
              Anubis, now I start
              On muddied bed
              So crowded I can’t draw his legs apart
              From my still hero’s stroll
              A jackal’s head
              Now on my own neck, weighing my own heart
              <br />
              An honorable fear
              Is not a boon
              Unlike a crescent made of newness near
              Which negates the black soul
              Of an old moon
              I crawl up to view my new God from here

                  Walked further than I usually do
                  On ushering of a ghoulish man
                  Night promenade towards windows through
                  Which I would gaze a staged élan


                  The hall was dressed with ambers, brown
                  But empty… ‘cept then I did find
                  A girl who held up one coal crown
                  To ashen dreams did bow my mind


                  Perhaps the idea of a ghost
                  Accepting offered arm on street
                  Was too expectant of this host
                  But hadn't she foretold we'd meet?


                  When I was young, oh Natalie
                  She lived not near, but miles away
                  I held her then returned to see
                  If she’d appear there the next day


                  So summers of my youth are gone
                  These winters of my passing years
                  Are darker than that late June lawn
                  A clearing made of woodened fears


                  I'm on a bus but barely there
                  She’s sirened sorry, spectrally!
                  Mind floats away to court its pair
                  Rejecting old dichotomy


                  Left suit and polished shoes accept
                  New invitation perfumed so
                  They navigate down steps inept
                  To watch another’s bones regrow


                  The caller rises from a soil
                  Compressing, sounds of xylophone
                  The smell of whiskey, wet and toil
                  Its jaw contorts to smile, groan


                  This figure lies to body’s ears
                  And moves towards eyes that will not see
                  The sooty queen who curtsies years
                  Nor, now a mother, Natalie


                  My ballroom wasn't ever grand
                  Too touched by misery so fine
                  I outstretch both a blackened hand
                  And dance with these three ghosts of mine

              So on with my gauze suit<br />
              And through holes: people who admit their feelings<br />
              <br />
              Ignoring the echo of automatic organs<br />
              See Id vs. superego, matter vs. antimatter<br />

I moved to the city<br />
I couldn't save myself from the city<br />
<br />
Squinting uphill towards wind blowing through buildings<br />
Gazing upwards for shadows on the highest floors<br />
<br />
Tear the optimism from me, remind me why I'm here<br />
The determined mind imagines a medicine's immediate effect<br />
<br />
Empty places that I like to visit<br />
Dark except street lamps and illuminated corridors<br />
<br />
A city college campus, a field after rain<br />
Pretending someone is looking for me<br />
<br />
I remember you in the first cold of fall<br />
We died in a quake, making mama cry<br />

It stalked the neighborhood<br />
Wearing the materials everyone wears<br />
But it's just the two of us now:<br />
After glancing at me in the mirror<br />
The monster sulks around the apartment<br />
Letting the settings carry part of the emotional charge<br />
<br />
Monsters want to feel alive too<br />
This monster can fly<br />
Just a few inches above the ground<br />
The ambient beauty that comes from grazing life's surfaces<br />
<br />
This monster seeks a lover who seeps into him<br />
But right now he's waiting from me in an unlit corner<br />
Or maybe he's riding the bus?<br />
Old familiar routes<br />
That connect the city like power lines<br />
lighting up little boxes of grief

        The obscured heads of cows: just backs in a field <br />

        A million and a half years going by<br />

        Past palm tree with rapier fronds<br />

        Loneliness and loss are mixed up with the glory<br />

        This destroyer alights of you<br />
