          GOWN OF HAIR</span><br />
        <small class="gown-text">
          Everything connects Like the trails of tiny hairs That cover your skin
          <br />
          In my current dream Your whole body disappears But your hairs hang there
          <br />
          As if placed to show In a fine arts museum On de la Renta
          <br />
          My memory’s bad So I can’t recall your eyes Nor how your nose turns
          <br />
          But your upper lip Had these tiny darkened hairs And I can picture those
          <br />
          <br />
          I once photographed You standing by a white wall In sunglasses
          <br />
          Though your lip hairs Aren’t visible in the Picture I took
          <br />
          I can imagine A thread that follows those hairs To ones on your nape
          <br />
          That's clear to me now Because it's my most recent Memory of us
          <br />
          <br />
          It's a gown really
          <br />
          Now that I think about it
          <br />
          It's a gown of hair
          <br />
          <br />
          It just isn't true That a dead body will keep On producing hairs
          <br />
          It’s actually The process of retreating Like skin in my dream
          <br />
          Please, if in yours You lament what we had/lost Think of bowls of fruit
          <br />
          Because what I see Is what one sees when they wish They knew how to love

          <span class="poem-name">VALLEY OF PEARLS</span><br />
          <small>
            In a valley of pearls   <br />
            Surrounded by better mountains
            <br />

            Palm trees stretch and cactus spreads   <br />
            Black blue west and gold blue east
            <br />
              <br />
            There’s just not much winter here
            <br />
            Only evergreen, the devil, is loose
            <br />
            Started buildings, unmanned cranes
              <br />Goats on two legs, breaking to but
            <br />
            <br />
            Someone owns that valley there
              <br />Jade plant, flower bed, patch of lawn
            <br />
            So they started, I restart
              <br />Cradled in violets, arbitrary dreams
            <br />

            <br />
            <small>

              I reach up to the moon<br />

              With one pale hand <br />

              And realize that we are not attuned<br />
              I step into my hole<br />
              Then carefully stand<br />
              To spare my mud wall etchings: they’ll dry soon<br />
              <br />
              I bend to ingest salts<br />
              Then eye my glyphs<br />
              And feel new neurotransmitters fill faults<br />
              I’ve drawn things to control<br />
              A God whose cliffs<br />
              Are more than fractured limestones and basalts<br />
              <br />

              I know my moon God errs  <br />
              But I still pray  <br />
              Ordering tiny soldier Egyptians  <br />
              To line up crown to sole  <br />
              That ancient way  <br />
              Until, in Rah’s tall tales, my figure wins  <br />
              <br />

              Now groans the moon’s dark side  <br />
              That I can’t see  <br />
              Though others from another earth have spied  <br />
              The crafted circle’s toll  <br />
              On Gods and me  <br />
              Imperfect beings weakened as they’ve lied  <br />
              <br />
              Anubis, now I start  <br />
              On muddied bed  <br />
              So crowded I can’t draw his legs apart  <br />
              From my still hero’s stroll  <br />
              A jackal’s head  <br />
              Now on my own neck, weighing my own heart  <br />
              <br />
              An honorable fear  <br />
              Is not a boon  <br />
              Unlike a crescent made of newness near  <br />
              Which negates the black soul  <br />
              Of an old moon  <br />
              I crawl up to view my new God from here

                  Walked further than I usually do  <br />
                  On ushering of a ghoulish man  <br />
                  Night promenade towards windows through  <br />
                  Which I would gaze a staged élan  <br />


                  The hall was dressed with ambers, brown  <br />
                  But empty… ‘cept then I did find  <br />
                  A girl who held up one coal crown  <br />
                  To ashen dreams did bow my mind  <br />


                  Perhaps the idea of a ghost  <br />
                  Accepting offered arm on street  <br />
                  Was too expectant of this host  <br />
                  But hadn't she foretold we'd meet?  <br />


                  When I was young, oh Natalie  <br />
                  She lived not near, but miles away  <br />
                  I held her then returned to see  <br />
                  If she’d appear there the next day  <br />


                  So summers of my youth are gone  <br />
                  These winters of my passing years  <br />
                  Are darker than that late June lawn  <br />
                  A clearing made of woodened fears  <br />


                  I'm on a bus but barely there  <br />
                  She’s sirened sorry, spectrally!  <br />
                  Mind floats away to court its pair  <br />
                  Rejecting old dichotomy  <br />


                  Left suit and polished shoes accept  <br />
                  New invitation perfumed so  <br />
                  They navigate down steps inept  <br />
                  To watch another’s bones regrow  <br />


                  The caller rises from a soil  <br />
                  Compressing, sounds of xylophone  <br />
                  The smell of whiskey, wet and toil  <br />
                  Its jaw contorts to smile, groan  <br />


                  This figure lies to body’s ears  <br />
                  And moves towards eyes that will not see  <br />
                  The sooty queen who curtsies years  <br />
                  Nor, now a mother, Natalie  <br />


                  My ballroom wasn't ever grand  <br />
                  Too touched by misery so fine  <br />
                  I outstretch both a blackened hand  <br />
                  And dance with these three ghosts of mine  <br />

      When I moved to the city I couldn't save myself from the city<br />

      Squinting uphill into air blown through buildings<br />
      Gazing upwards at shadows on the highest floors<br />
      <br />
      The determined mind imagines a medicine's immediate effect<br />
      So tear the optimism from me and remind me why I'm here<br />
      <br />
      ...
      <br />
      <br />

      A field after rain, a campus at nighttime<br />
      Dark except street lamps and illuminated corridors<br />
      <br />
      Empty places that I like to pass through<br />
      Make-believe beacons, pretending someone's looking for me<br />

        Wearing the materials<br />

        <br />
        Later I see it in the mirror:<br />

        A monster is skulking around my apartment<br />
        <br />
        Let the settings carry part of the emotional charge<br />
        <br />
        Because monsters just want to feel alive too<br />

        And sure this monster can fly<br />
        <br />
        A few inches above the ground<br />
        <br />
        On that ambient beauty that comes from grazing life's surfaces<br />

        <br />
        <br />
        This monster seeks someone who seeps into him<br />
        <br />
        Think about that, it's terrifying<br />
        <br />
        But right now it's lazing in an unlit corner<br />

        <br />...
        <br /><br />
        Or did it go?<br /><br />Riding its bus routes<br />
        <br />
        That connect the city like power lines<br />
        <br />
        Lighting up little boxes of grief

    <span id="angels-text" class="poem-name">ALL YOU ANGELS</span><br />
    <small class="angels-text">
        Met in the chaparral under the overpass<br />
        Past obscured cow heads: just backs in a field<br />
        Trucks on the overpass shedding their matter<br />
        Sounds of a million years going by<br />
        <br />
        ...
        <br />
          <br />
        I'm gonna waste my imagination on you<br />
        Like all the wet feathery words of insomnia <br />
        Or the way an "o" can fling open a word<br />
        Cause waves keep on breaking but you cannot count them<br />
        <br />
        ...
        <br />
        <br />
        Are we like angels? Saint You and Saint Me<br />
        Fatal, adoring self-absorption<br />
        Loneliness, loss are all mixed up with glory<br />
        This destroyer alights of you<br />
        <br />
        ...
        </br>
        </br>
        Riding a buffalo out of the town<br />
        Past all the palm tree with rapier fronds<br />
        Now in high desert, to my personal dust devil<br />
        Spinning and spinning and spinning for me<br />
        <br />
